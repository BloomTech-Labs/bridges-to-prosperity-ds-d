        "300+ sites were initially identified as part of an informal needs assessment conducted by our Rwanda field staff over 2013 and 2014. We collected much of the same data that we do now, but in a less structured format. When we created the database in 2017, we loaded all the old needs assessment into the general comments field on each bridge record (column L in this table), just to keep as a reference. We now believe that loading this data into our standard project assessments would be a benefit to future needs assessment work, both field-based and remote. We would love to see the needs assessment data from Column L parsed into the corresponding columns after it (M+), with a new row if there is existing data in those columns. If no corresponding column is obvious, we'd like to see new columns created for any extraneous data that is common to the old format. \n",

        "Any sites with a \"Yes\" in the column AQ have undergone a full technical review, and of those, the Stage (column L) can be considered to be correct. Any sites with a \"Yes\" in Column AQ have not undergone a full technical review, and the Stage is based on the assessor's initial estimate as to whether the site was technically feasible or not. We want to know if we can use the sites that have been reviewed to understand which of the sites that haven't yet been reviewed are likely to be rejected by the senior engineering team. Any of the data can be used, but our guess is that Estimated Span, Height Differential Between Banks, Created By, and Flag for Rejection are likely to be the most reliable predictors.\n",
